# Microposts

Project is built for learning purposes. I wanted to learn and practise how front-end gets connected with back-end, specifically Vue with Node and some Database, in this case it's MongoDB.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Express Server: http://localhost:5000
npm start

# Start Vue DevServer: http://localhost:8080
cd client
npm run serve

# Build for production (Will build into server/public, ready for deployment)
cd client
npm run build
```
